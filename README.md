Paginated student directory.

Javascript is used to dynamically pull in the correct number of students on each page.

10 students are displayed per page. If The number of students is not divisible by 10 the remainder of the students show on the last page.

The pagination is dynamically generated based on the number of students in the list.

The current page the user is currently visiting is highlighted in the pagination links.

This feature was tested with 44, 54 and 64 users.
